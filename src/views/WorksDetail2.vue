                        The insurance check came in the mail. From Geico. With its big-eyed lizard mascot. A Cockney gecko. As though disaster should appeal to ironic children. There are no geckos in Portland, Oregon—or in East London, for that matter. Not their natural habitat. But there are geckos in South Carolina. Andrew remembered them. In the winter they would sneak indoors and hide near curtains, frozen like novelty rubber until roused, and then such speed. Of course the goal was to catch one, to hold it in your palms, a brief warm home, until boredom set in, after which you’d release it onto the porch. The crueller boys did worse. With tennis racquets. With windups into trees followed by whoops. Geckos lose their tails if captured endwise, probably their most famous trait. Autotomy is the term, Greek for “self-severing,” which Andrew had misread last week as “serving.” Self-serving? No, no, se-ver-ing, as in divide by cutting. Certainly an effective means of survival. To lose what has been caught. But why a gecko should come to represent an insurance company baffled him, beyond the obvious wordplay, which seemed weak even for advertising and was outdone only by the Aflac Duck. In the darkness before the dawn—the dawn. This phrase had dropped into Andrew’s head a few days earlier, while he was buying groceries. Restocking those things with an expiration date: the eggs and the milk and the yogurt and the fruit—more fruit than he and Willa could ever consume within the allotted time period. Decay seemed built into the transaction. But, as Andrew watched the cashier ring up the strawberries and the blueberries and the apples and the bananas, this phrase unfurled in his thoughts, beyond his thoughts, really, since he had no notion of darkness or dawn under those fluorescent lights, innocuous soft rock coming down from above, the cheerful young woman bagging the produce. It was more like an archeological fragment from a still buried dream. Dust-covered and frayed along the edges. In the darkness before the dawn—the dawn. The rhythm relaxed him. The repetition pleasing, the sentiment mysteriously loaded. And the glory of that em dash. In the darkness before the dawn—the dawn. Andrew e-mailed himself the line, At Whole Foods the subject. The envelope from Geico lay unopened on the hall table for a month. Pretend forgotten. Like library books and bills, like the shirt he wore four days in a row. Right by the wooden bowl for house keys and loose change and lip balm and hair ties and other pocket sundries. A receipt that seemed too significant to abandon. But Andrew could borrow Ingrid and Ron’s car for only so long, so on Wednesday he finally deposited the check, and on Saturday he and Willa headed downtown, to Wentworth Subaru on Burnside. Maybe he should have got a sitter, as friends had suggested, but Willa had insisted beyond his capacity to say no. “Can we get the car right away?” she asked from the back seat. “Um, probably not right away,” Andrew said. Willa frowned. “Though I’m not sure. Maybe. I don’t know.”
